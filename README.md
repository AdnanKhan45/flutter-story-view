## Installation

To use this plugin, add `flutter_story_view` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Usage

Import the package into your code

```dart
import "package:flutter_story_view/flutter_story_view.dart";
```

Look inside `examples/example.dart` on how to use this library. You can copy
and paste the code into your `main.dart` and run to have a quick look.

## Basics

Use [`FlutterStoryView`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_story_view/latest/flutter_story_view/FlutterStoryView-class.html) to add stories in your Flutter App. `FlutterStoryView` class requires [`List<StoryItem>`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_story_view/latest/flutter_story_view/List<StoryItem>-class.html) and each story item has some fields like `url`, `duration`, and `type` and so on.
So having these, you can handily customize each single story the way you want.

* **Keep in mind** : The `type` must be specified with each `StoryItem`. You can access the `type` String from the class `StoryItemType` which comes built-in with this package.

* **StoryItem Image** :

```dart
final itemImage = StoryItem(
    url: "your image url/asset goes here",
    type: StoryItemType.image,
    viewers: [],
    duration: 3 // for image if duration was null it will be 3 by default.
);
```

* **StoryItem Video** :

```dart
final itemImage = StoryItem(
    url: "your video url/asset goes here",
    type: StoryItemType.video,
    viewers: [],
    duration: 10 // for video the duration would be 30 seconds if video duration gets longer than 30 seconds.
);
```
